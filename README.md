# Applied Responsive Web Design Projects: Build A Product Landing Page

- Fulfill the user stories by getting all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.
- Here's a working example. Try not to look at its code.
- You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://gitcdn.link/repo/freeCodeCamp/testable-projects-fcc/master/build/bundle.js
- Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.
- Remember to use the Read-Search-Ask method if you get stuck.

## Technology Stack
You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

## Content
 1. My product landing page should have a <header> element with corresponding id="header".
 2. I can see an image within the #header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
 3. Within the <header> element I can see a <nav> element with corresponding id="nav-bar".'
 4. I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class "nav-link".
 5. When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.'
 6. I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
 7. My landing page has a <form> element with a corresponding id="form".'
 8. Within the form, there is an <input> field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
 9. The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
 10. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
 11. Within the form, there is a submit <input> with corresponding id="submit".
 12. When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered (and that it posted successfully).

## Layout
 1. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
 2. My product landing page should have at least one media query.
 3. My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
